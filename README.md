# Installation of libraries 
To make it work correctly we need to install the following libraries :
```
pandas
matplotlib
numpy

```
# How do I start it? 
After you have made sure that all the necessary libraries are installed, download the main.py file and place it in the same directory as the .csv file.

*remember to change the name of the .csv file and columns to main.py*

***LINUX***
> python3 /home/main.py

If you don't know how to change the code you can see an ![example case](https://github.com/Enkk17/histogram-generator/tree/main/example_case) tested by me so you can orient yourself and see the graph
