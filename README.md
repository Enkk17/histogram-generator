# Installation of libraries
To make it work correctly we need to install the following libraries :
```
pandas
matplotlib
numpy
```
# How do I start it?

After you have made sure that all the necessary libraries are installed, download the main.py file and place it in the same directory as the .csv file.

*remember to change the name of the .csv file and columns to main.py*
